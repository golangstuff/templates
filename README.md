Subutai Template Generator

## Prerequisites

Two requirements only:

1. sudo working without asking for password
2. Working btrfs file system.  By default /var/snap/subutai/common/lxc is used so it will work on any host with Subutai installed.

##  Build

Build the appropriate template by running the appropriate script - for example ./debian-buster.  Resulting templates end up in ./build.
